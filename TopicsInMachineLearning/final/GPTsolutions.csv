9 * 4 = 36 (add the carried over 4, so 36 + 4 = 40, write down 0 and carry over 4 to the next digit)
9 * 5 = 45 (add the carried over 4, so 45 + 4 = 49, write down 9 and carry over 4 to the next digit)
9 * 8 = 72 (add the carried over 4, so 72 + 4 = 76, write down 6 and carry over 7 to the next digit)

Next, multiply 5852 by 6:
6 * 5 = 30 (write down 0 and carry over 3 to the next digit)
6 * 4 = 24 (add the carried over 3, so 24 + 3 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2 to the next digit)
6 * 5 = 30 (add the carried over 2, so 30 + 2 = 32, write down 2)

Finally, add up the results of the two multiplications:
   49  6
+    2  0
